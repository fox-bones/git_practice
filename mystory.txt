There once was a little imp, deep within the woods of grey... All day, all day, he ate naught 'cept hay. One day, a horse came looking for some grub... "Uhh... Hey little impy. Got yourself a feast! Mind a matter, may I take a little piece?" The imp said, "No, go neigh off somewhere else!," then continued to eat until he fell off his shelf, high up in the oaks.
